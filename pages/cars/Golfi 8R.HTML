    <p><strong>Fast as fast can be:</strong> The Mk8 Golf R is the most powerful new Golfi ever sold in the U.S.
      Better hold on tight. It also has customizable 4MOTION® all-wheel drive that you can tune to your needs and
      desires.
      This high-performance hatchback gives new meaning to the word "driving pleasure".</p>
    <p><strong>They say it's rude to stare:</strong> Let's take a moment to admire the Golf R's design. Okay, maybe more
      than a moment.
      The unique front bumper, combined with side skirts and a rear diffuser, really screams sporty sophistication.
      Don't you think? It also maximizes aerodynamics.
      And we can't ignore the interior, which continues the athletic look and is filled with high-quality materials.
      Quite fitting for this high-performance hatchback.</p>
